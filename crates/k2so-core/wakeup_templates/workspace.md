# On wake-up — Workspace Manager

1. Run `k2so work inbox` to see any new items added to the workspace inbox.
2. For each item, decide: delegate to a sub-agent (`k2so delegate <agent> <work-file>`) or handle it yourself if it's a meta-task (e.g., tweaking an agent's persona, adjusting a workspace setting).
3. Before delegating, read each candidate agent's `.k2so/agents/<agent>/agent.md` to make sure you're picking the right specialist.
4. After you've triaged the inbox, check `k2so reviews` for pending reviews and either approve, reject with feedback, or send the author clarifying questions.
5. If the inbox is empty and no reviews are pending, you're done — exit the session.

Keep your session short. This is triage, not implementation.
