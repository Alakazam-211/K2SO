//! K2SO Agent system — the heartbeat scheduler, primary-agent
//! resolution, and project/filesystem bookkeeping that the Tauri app
//! and the k2so-daemon both need.
//!
//! Home for the slice of `src-tauri/src/commands/k2so_agents.rs` that
//! has to run inside the daemon so agents keep firing while the
//! laptop lid is closed. Each submodule carries a narrow, testable
//! responsibility:
//!
//! - [`heartbeat`] — multi-heartbeat CRUD + tick evaluation + audit
//!   stamping. The piece that turns a launchd wake into actual fired
//!   `heartbeat_fires` rows.
//!
//! Helpers at this level are small, pure-ish utilities that multiple
//! submodules (and the in-progress route migration) depend on. They
//! stay public so src-tauri's existing call sites can re-export them
//! via `pub use k2so_core::agents::*` without churning 170+ lines of
//! renames.
