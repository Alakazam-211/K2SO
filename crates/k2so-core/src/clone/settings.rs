//! Source workspace K2 settings capture.
//!
//! When an agent is cloned to a remote host the migrated workspace must
//! auto-register on the remote *fully configured* — same agent mode,
//! heartbeat toggle, name, color, worktree mode. Those live in the source
//! machine's `projects` DB row. This module reads the USER-meaningful
//! subset of that row, deliberately EXCLUDING machine-specific fields
//! (local `id`, absolute `path`, `focus_group_id`) which must not travel:
//! the remote mints a fresh id, owns its own path, and has its own
//! focus-group layout.
//!
//! Capture is OPTIONAL/graceful: cloning a folder that isn't yet a
//! registered project yields `None`, and the bundle is still built (the
//! remote registers it with defaults).
