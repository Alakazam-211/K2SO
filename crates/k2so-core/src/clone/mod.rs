//! K2 Connect "Clone to" — the pure bundle engine.
//!
//! An agent's full state lives in **three** filesystem locations, and a
//! one-click migration to a remote host has to gather all three, scrub
//! the secrets, drop the bulk, and package the result so the remote can
//! reconstruct a resumable agent at recomputed paths. This module is the
//! shared CORE that does the gathering + scrubbing + packaging. It has
//! NO HTTP, NO Tauri, NO daemon — it is a pure, unit-testable library
//! consumed by both the high-bar "Clone to" push (P2) and the
//! save-locally README fallback (P3).
//!
//! ## The three locations (see PRD `k2-connect-clone-to.md`)
//! For a project at `PROJECT` with
//! `SLUG = chat_history::claude_project_hash(PROJECT)`:
//! 1. **Workspace dir** — the `PROJECT` tree (`.k2so/`, project-local
//!    `.claude/`, config/persona/tools/docs), minus excludes + scrubbed
//!    secrets.
//! 2. **Durable memory** — the entire `<home>/.claude/projects/<SLUG>/
//!    memory/` directory (`MEMORY.md` + every `*.md`).
//! 3. **Live session(s)** — `<session-id>.jsonl` directly under
//!    `<home>/.claude/projects/<SLUG>/`. Default: the newest-mtime one
//!    (the conversation you're in). Opt-in: all of them. Worktree
//!    variants live under `<SLUG>-<branch>/`.
//!
//! ## Pipeline
//! `inventory()` resolves PROJECT + SLUG, walks the three locations
//! (honoring `.gitignore`/`.k2soignore` + the bulk skip-list via the
//! `ignore` crate), runs the secret classifier, and returns a structured
//! [`CloneInventory`]. `CloneInventory::manifest()` produces the
//! serializable [`CloneManifest`] (entry list + re-supply report + source
//! slug + metadata). `build_bundle()` tar+gz's the included files under
//! per-class subdirs (`workspace/`, `memory/`, `sessions/`) alongside
//! `manifest.json`.
