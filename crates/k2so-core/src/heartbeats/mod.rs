//! Multi-heartbeat CRUD + tick evaluation + audit stamping.
//!
//! This is the piece that makes the persistent-agents feature real:
//! when launchd wakes the laptop and fires the heartbeat plist, the
//! daemon calls [`k2so_agents_heartbeat_tick`] to find eligible
//! heartbeats, runs them, and stamps audit rows so
//! `k2so heartbeat status <name>` can show what happened.
//!
//! The entire surface is Tauri-free. src-tauri keeps `#[tauri::command]`
//! wrappers around these functions so the existing UI frontend keeps
//! working unchanged; the daemon calls them directly over its HTTP
//! routes (`/cli/heartbeat/*`).
//!
//! See `.k2so/prds/multi-schedule-heartbeat.md` for the data-model
//! decisions behind this (per-heartbeat folder + `WAKEUP.md`,
//! workspace-relative `wakeup_path`, `heartbeat_fires` audit table).
