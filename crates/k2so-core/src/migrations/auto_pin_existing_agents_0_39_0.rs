//! `auto_pin_existing_agents_0_39_0` — pin existing agent-mode
//! workspaces on upgrade to 0.39.0.
//!
//! Pre-0.39.0 the sidebar auto-promoted every workspace with
//! `agent_mode in ('agent', 'custom', 'manager', 'coordinator', 'pod')`
//! to a dedicated "Agents & Pinned" section above the user's manually
//! pinned workspaces. That auto-promotion was retired in 0.39.0 —
//! agent-mode workspaces now flow through the same Pinned / focus
//! group / ungrouped lists as any other workspace.
//!
//! Without a migration, the visible effect would be: every workspace
//! that previously appeared in the auto-promoted Agents section
//! *disappears* from the top of the user's nav on first 0.39.0 launch
//! (they're still there, just in the ungrouped section or their focus
//! group — but the user doesn't know that). This migration prevents
//! that surprise by flipping `pinned = 1` for every agent-mode
//! workspace that wasn't already pinned, so they keep appearing in
//! the Pinned section.
//!
//! Users who DON'T want agent-mode workspaces in their Pinned section
//! can unpin via the existing UI affordance (right-click → Unpin).
//! Future workspaces switched into agent mode (post-0.39.0) do NOT
//! auto-pin — they flow through the normal sections like any other
//! workspace.
//!
//! Gated by the `code_migrations` table (one-shot per local DB).
