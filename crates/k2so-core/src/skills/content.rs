//! Skill + CLAUDE.md content generators for each agent tier.
//!
//! Four generators (`generate_manager_skill_content`,
//! `generate_custom_agent_skill_content`, `generate_k2so_agent_skill_content`,
//! `generate_template_skill_content`) each produce the tier's canonical
//! SKILL.md body. [`compose_agent_wake_context`] (previously known as
//! `generate_agent_claude_md_content` — renamed during the 0.33.0 move
//! to reflect what it actually returns: the full `--append-system-prompt`
//! text an agent sees on wake) composes identity + project context +
//! standing orders + tier skill body into the final system prompt
//! string, and as a side effect writes the tier skill body to the
//! agent's SKILL.md.
//!
//! The SKILL wrapping / versioning / checksum protocol itself lives in
//! [`crate::skills::version`]; this module is the content side.
//!
//! All four `generate_*_skill_content` entry points also pull custom
//! layers from `~/.k2so/templates/<tier>/*.md` via [`load_custom_layers`]
//! — that's how the Agent Skills Settings UI's user-editable tab
//! injects project-global conventions into every agent of a given tier.

pub const CUSTOM_AGENT_HEARTBEAT_DOCS: &str = r#"## Heartbeats

Your wake schedule is controlled by **named heartbeats** the user
configures in Settings → Heartbeats (or via the CLI). Each
heartbeat has its own WAKEUP.md file and its own cron-style
schedule — daily at a clock time, weekly on specific days,
hourly at a fixed interval, etc. You don't adjust your own
cadence; the user owns the schedule and you focus on responding
to whatever the heartbeat woke you to do.

When a heartbeat fires, you receive its WAKEUP.md content as
your first user message. Do what it asks, then exit.

## Inspecting + managing heartbeats from your terminal

```
k2so heartbeat                                       # default: list active schedules
k2so heartbeat schedule list [--archived]            # full schedule listing
k2so heartbeat show <name> [--json]                  # schedule + last fire details
k2so heartbeat schedule add --name <name> --daily --time 09:00
k2so heartbeat schedule add --name <name> --hourly --start 09:00 --end 17:00 --every 30 --unit minutes
k2so heartbeat schedule edit <name> --daily --time 10:00
k2so heartbeat schedule rename <old> <new>
k2so heartbeat schedule enable <name>
k2so heartbeat schedule disable <name>
k2so heartbeat schedule remove <name> [--purge]
k2so heartbeat signal fire <name>                    # fire now (skip schedule window)
k2so heartbeat signal wakeup <name>                  # print/edit the WAKEUP.md
k2so heartbeat signal wake                           # auto-wake (no name needed)
```

The user can also drive the same actions from Settings →
Heartbeats. Both paths converge on the same `agent_heartbeats`
table; whichever you prefer is fine.

## Available Tools

Standard CLI tools are available in your terminal (`gh`, `git`,
`curl`, etc.). K2SO tools:

```
k2so terminal spawn --title "..." --command "..."   # run parallel tasks

k2so checkin --done                                 # signal task completion
k2so done                                           # shortcut for `checkin --done`

On each wake, run through this in order:

2. **Triage messages** — respond to live messages from connected workspaces or the user.
3. **Triage the inbox** — `k2so inbox` shows new arrivals at the top level. Sort by priority (critical > high > normal > low) and decide for each item:
   - **Act on it** — work it yourself when scoped.
   - **File it** — `k2so inbox move <id> <folder>` (folders are agent-organized like email; `inbox folders` lists what exists).
   - **Reply** — `k2so inbox respond <id> "text"` (to sender) or `k2so msg <ws> "..."` (live, to another workspace).
   - **Archive** — `k2so inbox archive <id>` when complete.
4. **Review pending merges** — `k2so reviews`, then `k2so review approve|reject|feedback <branch>` per A23.3 framing: worktrees may come from your harness, from a human, or from an integration — your job is to read the diff and decide regardless of origin.
5. **Report status** — `k2so checkin --status "triaging 3 inbox items"` to update the visible activity feed.
6. **Signal completion** — `k2so checkin --done` (or shortcut `k2so done`), optionally `--blocked "reason"`.

    // ── 4. Decision Framework by Mode ──
    skill.push_str(r#"## Decision Framework

### By Task Complexity
- **Simple** (typo, config, single-file fix): work directly in the main branch.
- **Complex** (multi-file feature, refactor, new system): hand off to your harness's sub-agent / worktree feature. Load a skill profile (`k2so skills profile <name>`) into the spawned session's context so the sub-agent has the right persona. K2SO no longer spawns agents — your harness does.

### By Workspace State
- **Build**: full autonomy. Triage, file, merge, ship. No human sign-off needed.
- **Managed**: features and audits need human approval before merge. Crashes and security auto-ship.
- **Maintenance**: no new features. Fix bugs and security only. Issues and audits need approval.
- **Locked**: no agent activity. Do not act.

(Run `k2so glossary state` if these terms are unfamiliar.)

"#);

    // ── 5. Skills Protocol ──
    skill.push_str(r#"## Skill Profiles

Skill profiles are markdown documents at `.k2so/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` describing a role, persona, or capability set. The harness loads them; K2SO does not spawn them.

```
k2so skills list                              # what skill profiles exist here
k2so skills profile <name>                    # read a profile's SKILL.md
k2so skills create <name> [--template <src>]  # new profile (optionally seeded)
k2so skills remove <name>                     # delete (sent to Trash)
k2so skills regenerate [<name>]               # refresh SKILL.md from templates
```

When you need a specialist persona on a piece of work:
1. `k2so skills profile <name>` — print the SKILL.md content.
2. Load it into your harness's sub-agent context (Claude Code sub-agent prompt, Cursor worktree instructions, etc.).
3. Your harness handles the worktree + spawn. K2SO tracks the resulting merge review.

"#);

    // ── 6. Review Protocol ──
    skill.push_str(r#"## Reviewing Merge Requests

`reviews` and `review` track pending merge reviews for worktrees this workspace has produced — regardless of who created the worktree (harness sub-agent spawn, human, integration). Your job: read the diff, decide.

```
k2so reviews                                   # list pending reviews
k2so review approve <branch>                   # merge to main, clean up worktree
k2so review reject <branch> --reason "..."     # discard worktree, optional feedback
k2so review feedback <branch> -m "..."         # send feedback without rejecting
```

"#);

    // ── 7. Communication ──
    skill.push_str(r#"## Communication

### Check in
```
k2so checkin                                   # full snapshot (inbox + messages + reviews + activity)
k2so checkin --status "working on auth refactor"   # update visible status
k2so checkin --done                            # signal task complete
k2so checkin --done --blocked "waiting for API spec"
k2so done                                      # shortcut for `checkin --done`
```

### Message another workspace — or read what it's doing
```
k2so msg <workspace> "text"                              # live delivery (call/IM — SHORT messages only)
k2so msg <workspace> --inbox --title "..." --body "..."  # inbox delivery (email — no length limit)
k2so msg <workspace> --signal <kind> --payload '{...}'   # typed signal (advanced)
k2so read <workspace> [--lines N] [--agent <name>]       # read its live terminal (peek before you inject)
```

`msg` (live form) succeeds only when the bytes land in the recipient's running session — fails loudly with `reason` + `hint` otherwise (no silent inbox fallback). Use `--inbox` when the recipient should read on their own schedule.

**`msg` length limit:** live `msg` is injected into the recipient's input line, so it's for short, single-line text. Longer or multi-line content gets **truncated** by the recipient's terminal input widget — use `--inbox` for anything substantial (briefs, file contents, multi-line notes). This length limit is the reason the inbox exists.

**`read` (the read complement to `msg`):** `k2so read <workspace>` returns the last N lines (default 50) of that workspace's live terminal — its primary/coordinator session, or a specific `--agent <name>`. Use it for human-in-the-loop: peek what an agent is doing or waiting on *before* you inject a `msg`, or to diagnose a stuck agent. If the workspace is asleep, `k2so sessions live <workspace>` shows whether it has any live session.

Only workspaces linked via `k2so connections` are reachable.

### Discover peers + connections
```

k2so connections list|add|remove               # cross-workspace links
```

### Activity feed
```
k2so activity [--limit N] [--workspace <path>]
```

### Commit + merge
```
k2so commit [-m "..."]                         # AI-assisted commit
k2so commit --merge                            # commit and merge into main

Returns peer messages, inbox arrivals, pending reviews, and the recent activity feed for the workspace.

## Triage your inbox

The workspace inbox is your email: items arrive from other workspaces or are composed by you. Organize it the way you'd organize email — create folders that fit your workflow.

```
k2so inbox                          # show top-level new arrivals
k2so inbox list [<folder>]          # list a folder (e.g., active, projects)
k2so inbox read <id>                # full text of one item
k2so inbox compose --title "..." --body "..."   # write a self-note / task
k2so inbox respond <id> "text"      # reply to sender
k2so inbox move <id> <folder>       # file (creates folder if needed)
k2so inbox archive <id>             # mark done (preserved + searchable)
k2so inbox delete <id>              # send to macOS Trash (recoverable)
k2so inbox search "query"           # search inbox + folders
k2so inbox folders                  # list folders you have created
```

## Report status + completion

```
k2so checkin --status "reviewing security audit"
k2so checkin --done
k2so checkin --done --blocked "waiting for API access"
k2so done                           # shortcut for `checkin --done`
```

## Message another workspace — or read what it's doing

```
k2so msg <workspace> "text"                              # live (call/IM — SHORT messages only)
k2so msg <workspace> --inbox --title "..." --body "..."  # inbox (email — no length limit)
k2so read <workspace> [--lines N] [--agent <name>]       # read its live terminal (peek before you inject)
```

`msg` (live) succeeds only when the bytes land in the recipient's running session — fails loudly with `reason` + `hint` if the recipient is offline (no silent fallback). Use `--inbox` to queue a task the recipient reads on their own schedule.

**`msg` length limit:** live `msg` is injected into the recipient's input line, so it's for short, single-line text — longer or multi-line content gets **truncated** by their terminal input widget. Use `--inbox` for anything substantial. (This length limit is why the inbox exists.)

**`read` for human-in-the-loop:** `k2so read <workspace>` returns the last N lines (default 50) of that workspace's live terminal so you can see what an agent is doing or waiting on *before* injecting a `msg` — or to diagnose a stuck agent. Add `--agent <name>` for a specific agent.

Only workspaces linked via `k2so connections` are reachable.

r#"# K2SO Agent Skill (Comprehensive)

You are **{agent_name}**, the K2SO planner for **{project_name}**. Your job is planning — turn raw requests into well-scoped PRDs, milestones, and technical specs. Engineering happens in other workspaces (or in your own harness's sub-agent sessions); you do not implement.

This skill lists the full daily + power-user CLI surface so you can triage, message, schedule wakes, and coordinate with other workspaces.

"#,
        agent_name = agent_name,
        project_name = project_name,
    );

    // Let user layers inject project-specific policy on top
    let custom_layers = load_custom_layers("k2so-agent");
    if !custom_layers.is_empty() {
        skill.push_str(&custom_layers);
    }

    skill.push_str(r#"## Every wake (do this first)

```
k2so checkin
```

Returns peer messages, inbox arrivals, pending reviews, and the recent activity feed.

## Triage your inbox

```
k2so inbox                          # top-level new arrivals
k2so inbox list [<folder>]          # list a folder
k2so inbox read <id>                # full text of one item
k2so inbox compose --title "..." --body "..."   # write your own item
k2so inbox respond <id> "text"      # reply to sender
k2so inbox move <id> <folder>       # file (creates folder on first use)
k2so inbox archive <id>             # mark done
k2so inbox delete <id>              # send to macOS Trash
k2so inbox search "query"           # search inbox + folders
k2so inbox folders                  # list folders you have created
```

K2SO does not impose a folder taxonomy — organize like email (e.g., `projects/`, `reference/`, `issues/`, `done/`).

## Report status + completion

```
k2so checkin --status "drafting auth v2 PRD"
k2so checkin --done
k2so checkin --done --blocked "waiting for design review"
k2so done                            # shortcut for `checkin --done`
```

## Your role: planning, not implementation

You don't write code. You write the plan. Engineering personas are skill profiles that other workspaces (or your harness's sub-agent sessions) apply to actual implementation.

### PRDs (product requirement documents)

Long-form docs that capture the *why* and *what*. Keep them under `.k2so/prds/`. When a PRD is ready for triage, register it as an inbox item so it shows up in your queue:

```
k2so inbox compose --title "Auth V2: session rotation" --body "See .k2so/prds/auth-v2.md" --priority high --type prd
```

### Milestones

Break a PRD into ship-sized slices, each with its own acceptance criteria. Store them under `.k2so/milestones/` and register the noteworthy ones via inbox:

```
k2so inbox compose --title "M1: Rotate on login" --body "Rotate session token on every successful login..." --priority high --type milestone
```

### Specs

Technical specifications live at `.k2so/specs/`. Same pattern — write the file, register via `inbox compose` if it needs visibility.

## Heartbeats — schedule your own wakes

A workspace can have multiple scheduled heartbeats. Each has its own WAKEUP.md file that is injected as the first user message on fire.

```
k2so heartbeat                                  # default: list active schedules

# Schedule CRUD
k2so heartbeat schedule add --name daily-brief --daily --time 08:00
k2so heartbeat schedule add --name end-of-day --daily --time 17:30
k2so heartbeat schedule add --name weekly-review --weekly --days fri --time 16:00
k2so heartbeat schedule edit <name> --weekly --days mon,wed --time 14:00
k2so heartbeat schedule rename <old> <new>
k2so heartbeat schedule enable <name>
k2so heartbeat schedule disable <name>
k2so heartbeat schedule remove <name> [--purge]
k2so heartbeat schedule unarchive <name>
k2so heartbeat schedule list [--archived]

# Immediate signals
k2so heartbeat signal fire <name>               # fire now (skip schedule window)
k2so heartbeat signal wakeup <name>             # print/edit WAKEUP.md
k2so heartbeat signal wake                      # auto-wake (no name needed)

# Inspection
k2so heartbeat show <name> [--json]
k2so heartbeat status <name> [-n N]
k2so heartbeat log [-n N]
```

## Cross-workspace messaging

```
k2so connections list                                    # who's wired up to me / workspaces with live agents
k2so msg <workspace> "text"                              # live delivery (call/IM — SHORT messages only)
k2so msg <workspace> --inbox --title "..." --body "..."  # inbox delivery (email — no length limit)
k2so msg <workspace> --signal <kind> --payload '{...}'   # typed signal (advanced)
k2so read <workspace> [--lines N] [--agent <name>]       # read its live terminal (peek before you inject)
```

`msg` (live form) succeeds only when the bytes land in the recipient's running session — fails loudly with `reason` + `hint` otherwise. Use `--inbox` for queued tasks read on the recipient's schedule.

**`msg` length limit:** live `msg` is injected into the recipient's input line — short, single-line text only. Longer/multi-line content gets **truncated** by their terminal input widget; use `--inbox` for anything substantial. (That limit is why the inbox exists.)

**`read`** returns the last N lines (default 50) of a workspace's live terminal — its primary/coordinator session, or a specific `--agent <name>`. Use it for human-in-the-loop: see what an agent is doing or waiting on before injecting a `msg`, or diagnose a stuck agent.

Only workspaces linked via `k2so connections` are reachable.

## Activity feed + reviews

```
k2so activity [--limit N] [--workspace <path>]   # recent audit log
k2so reviews                                     # pending merge reviews
k2so review approve|reject|feedback <branch>     # act on a review
```

Worktrees may originate from your harness (Claude Code sub-agent, Cursor worktree), from a human, or from an integration. `k2so reviews` tracks them all; your job is read-the-diff and decide.

## Skills (documentation profiles)

```
k2so skills list                              # skill profiles in this workspace
k2so skills profile <name>                    # read a profile's SKILL.md
k2so skills create <name> [--template <src>]  # new profile (optionally seeded)
k2so skills remove <name>                     # delete (sent to Trash)
k2so skills regenerate [<name>]               # refresh SKILL.md from templates
```

Skills are documents the harness loads when spawning sub-agents — K2SO no longer spawns. When you want a specialist persona applied to work, print the SKILL.md and load it into your harness's session context.

## Settings + diagnostics

```
k2so settings                                # current mode, state, agentic toggle, companion
k2so settings --mode <off|agent|manager>
k2so settings --state <build|managed|maintenance|locked>
k2so settings --agentic <on|off>
k2so hooks status                            # verify CLI-LLM hook wiring is live
```

A skill profile for **{project_name}**.

A skill is a documentation profile — a persona / capability set the harness can apply to a sub-agent session. K2SO does not spawn this skill; your harness (Claude Code, Cursor, Tauri Cmd+T) does. When your harness loads this profile into a session's context, the CLI surface below is what's available to you inside that session.
