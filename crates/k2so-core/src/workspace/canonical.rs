//! Canonical-agents core: per-harness state detection + the
//! deterministic safety net (the ONLY destructive surface).
//!
//! This module backs the **K2 Canonical Agent** skill (PRD
//! `.k2so/prds/k2-canonical-agents.md`, §5 + §6). It does two jobs and
//! no more:
//!
//! 1. **Detect** per-harness canonical state without mutating anything
//!    ([`detect_canonical_state`], §5.2). Per-file probe over the 6
//!    [`HARNESS_WORKSPACE_FILES`] plus the extended
//!    [`HARNESS_PROBE_TARGETS`] list via `fs::symlink_metadata` +
//!    `read_link` + the `k2so_generated:` signature. NO directory-level
//!    canonicalization — scope is per-file.
//!
//! 2. **Safely persist / unwind** agent-authored or generated content
//!    ([`run_canonical_setup`], [`unwind_canonical`],
//!    [`persist_agent_md`], §6). The core's job is narrow and
//!    irreversible-only: back up every touched original to
//!    `.k2so/backups/<ISO-ts>/<relpath>` BEFORE any write, record a
//!    `manifest.json` (original path, backup path, pre-content hash,
//!    action, target harness), write COPIES (not symlinks) stamped with
//!    a `k2so_generated:` signature + an "edit `.k2so/...` instead"
//!    header, all via [`crate::fs_atomic::atomic_write_str`]. Default is
//!    **dry-run**; writes require an explicit `confirm`. A best-effort
//!    preflight refuses when a live agent session is reading the
//!    targets (offers `force`).
//!
//! **Model A (PRD §5.1):** `.k2so/agent/AGENT.md` + `.k2so/PROJECT.md`
//! are the canonical source of truth; per-harness files
//! (`CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, …) are generated mirrors. The agent
//! supplies the merged body text; this core never authors content — it
//! only does the backup + atomic-write + manifest around the bytes the
//! agent hands it, so role re-runs and canonical setups are
//! byte-reversible.
