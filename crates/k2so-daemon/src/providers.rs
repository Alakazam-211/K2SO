///    even if auto-launch fails (no profile, bad spawn config),
///    the signal stays on disk and the next user-triggered spawn
///    will drain it.
///
/// 2. **Auto-launch (G4):** if the target agent has a
///    `<project>/.k2so/agents/<agent>/AGENT.md` launch profile
///    (G3's `launch_profile::load_launch_profile`), spawn a fresh
///    session using that profile. The spawn path then drains the
///    pending-live queue in order, and the just-enqueued signal
///    becomes the session's first byte of input.
///
/// Race-safe single-flight: before spawning, re-check
/// `session_map::lookup(agent)`. If a concurrent path (another
/// signal's wake, a `/cli/sessions/spawn` arriving mid-flight)
/// already registered the session, we skip — the queued signal
/// will be drained by the now-live session path naturally.
///
/// The `from.workspace` field on the signal supplies the project
/// id used to locate `AGENT.md`. After G0's CLI resolver, this
/// is a UUID matching `projects.id`; we look it up to get the
/// filesystem path. Signals with a stale or unknown workspace id
