//! 0.38.0 Commit 4 — daemon-owned session lifecycle broadcast.
//!
//! Push-driven counterpart to `/cli/sessions/list-for-workspace`.
//! Every `v2_session_map::register` / `unregister` call publishes a
//! `SessionEvent` onto a process-wide `tokio::sync::broadcast` channel.
//! `session_events_ws::serve_session_events_connection` fans those
//! events out to each `/cli/sessions/events?path=<workspace>` WS
//! subscriber, filtering by `cwd starts_with workspace_path` (same
//! rule the existing list-for-workspace endpoint uses in `cli.rs`).
//!
//! Why a broadcast bus instead of per-subscriber polling: the
//! renderer used to discover new daemon-owned PTYs only on workspace
//! switch (`loadLayoutForWorkspace` triggers `reconcileWithDaemon`).
//! That left every other connected window stale until the user
//! manually re-opened the workspace. Push-driven adoption + drop
//! means Cmd+T in window A surfaces the new tab in window B + the
//! mobile companion within one network hop.
//!
//! Initialization: a `OnceLock<Sender<SessionEvent>>` lazily creates
//! the channel on first `sender()` call. Test environments that
//! never call into `register`/`unregister` won't initialize it;
//! emit sites use `let _ = ` to ignore the case where the bus has
//! no live subscribers (broadcast::send returns an Err in that
//! case but we treat it as a no-op).
