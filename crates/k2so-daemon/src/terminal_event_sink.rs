//! Phase 2 Unit 3 — daemon-side `TerminalEventSink`.
//!
//! Routes `k2so_core::terminal::event_sink::TerminalEventSink` events
//! (`on_title`, `on_bell`, `on_exit`, `on_grid_update`) onto the
//! daemon's broadcast channel as `WireEvent` frames. Tauri's
//! `daemon_events.rs` receives the frames over `/events` WS and
//! re-emits them via `AppHandle::emit(&event_name, payload)` — the
//! same event names the renderer already listens to
//! (`terminal:grid:<id>`, `terminal:title:<id>`, etc.). The renderer
//! contract is unchanged; only the producer moved.
//!
//! # F2 tokio Handle capture
//!
//! Terminal grid/title/exit events are fired from alacritty's PTY
//! reader thread — a `std::thread::spawn`'d worker that has no
//! ambient tokio runtime. The `Sender::send` on a tokio
//! `broadcast::Sender` does not itself require a runtime context
//! (it's synchronous internally), so unlike Unit 1's companion
//! subscriber we do not need to dispatch via a captured `Handle`
//! here. We keep the handle in the struct anyway as a placeholder
//! for future paths that *do* need a runtime (e.g. forwarding to a
//! tokio mpsc with bounded backpressure or awaiting an async
//! permit). Cheap; documents the F2 pattern explicitly so the next
//! agent sees how to extend.
//!
//! # Lifecycle ownership
//!
//! Register once during daemon startup, before any
//! `TerminalManager::create()` call lands. The sink is process-wide
//! and lives for the daemon's lifetime — the broadcast channel
//! outlives it (it's owned by `main.rs`).
