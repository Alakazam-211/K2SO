//! HTTP route dispatcher for the k2so-daemon binary.
//!
//! Pre-0.39.0 this entire function body lived inline in `main.rs`'s
//! `handle_connection`. Extraction is a mechanical move — every match
//! arm, every per-route comment, every method-gating guard is preserved
//! verbatim. HTTP framing helpers (`send_response`, `send_cors_preflight`,
//! `require_post`, `read_post_body`, `token_ok`, `parse_params`) live in
//! the sibling `routes::http` module; the dispatch sub-helpers
//! (`handle_archive_orphans`, `dispatch_unit6_post`) live at the bottom
//! of this file.
//!
//! `/cli/*` POST routes use `super::http::require_post` to enforce
//! method gating per [[feedback_post_only_route_guards]] memory; the
//! starts_with arms (`/cli/git/`, `/cli/states/`, `/cli/workspaces/`,
//! `/cli/focus-groups/`, `/cli/sections/`, `/cli/workspace-layouts/`,
//! `/cli/timer/`, `/cli/presets/`, `/cli/window-state/`,
//! `/cli/projects/`, `/cli/fs/`, `/cli/chat/`, `/cli/themes/`,
//! `/cli/skill-layers/`, `/cli/review-checklist/`, `/cli/inbox/`)
//! inherit the gate from the top-level `method != "GET" && !(is_post &&
//! post_allowed)` 405 short-circuit. See `feedback_post_only_route_guards`
