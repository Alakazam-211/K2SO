//! Daemon boot-phase state — the single source of truth behind the
//! `/boot-status` handshake and the dispatcher's readiness gate.
//!
//! ## Why this exists (0.39.5)
//!
//! Pre-0.39.5 the daemon ran every first-boot migration (the
//! 64-workspace unification + skills-consolidation + auto-pin sweep)
//! BEFORE it bound its port. During a 0.38.x → 0.39.x auto-update the
//! NEW daemon was therefore unreachable for the entire migration
//! window — while the OUTGOING old daemon was still bound to the stable
//! port and still answered `/ping` with 200. The renderer's
//! `ConnectionGate` took that false-positive "healthy" ping, mounted
//! the app, and its store fetches landed in the gap where the old
//! daemon had been killed and the new one was still migrating → blank
//! window ("appears to have crashed").
//!
//! The fix: bind the listener FIRST, advertise progress here, and have
//! the dispatcher 503 every real route until [`set_ready`] runs. The
//! renderer reads `phase` + `version` from `/boot-status` and only
//! mounts against a daemon whose version is paired with the app AND
//! whose phase is `ready` — so it can never bind to the outgoing old
//! daemon, and it can SHOW the user the migration is in progress.
//!
//! See `[[project_daemon_handshake_contract]]` and
//! `release-notes-0.39.5.md`.
