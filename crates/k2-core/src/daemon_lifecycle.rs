//! Headless-friendly abstractions for daemon lifecycle wiring.
//!
//! **K2 Connect prep**: this module owns the *logic* of "where does the
//! daemon binary live?" and "what arguments would launchctl need to
//! load / kick / unload the daemon plist?" — independent of any actual
//! filesystem-touching or process-spawning. K2 Connect's headless flow
//! (Tauri-less daemons running on remote hosts) calls into the same
//! plist generator + arg builders here so a remote-daemon scenario
//! can produce a launchd plist + bootstrap script without dragging in
//! Tauri.
//!
//! `crate::wake` owns the FS write + actual `launchctl load/unload/list`
//! invocations. This module owns the **shape** of those calls: the
//! canonical label, the relative path where K2SO.app keeps the daemon
//! binary, the launchctl kickstart target string. The Tauri commands
//! in `src-tauri/src/commands/daemon.rs` are now thin wrappers around
//! these helpers + a plain `Command::new("launchctl")` invocation.
//!
//! Why a separate module from `wake`?
//! - `wake` is the implementation surface for "install + unload + check
//!   loaded state." Heavy because it writes files and shells out.
//! - `daemon_lifecycle` is the **pure** surface: no FS, no subprocess.
//!   Pure data + arg-vec construction. Cheap to test in isolation and
//!   trivial to call from K2 Connect orchestration code that doesn't
//!   want to accidentally trigger an actual install.
