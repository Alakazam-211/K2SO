// K2SO #682 — pinned-chat spawn circuit breaker.
//
// The pinned Chat tab resolves a launch config and spawns `claude`. If the
// child exits almost immediately (e.g. `claude --session-id <uuid>` where the
// uuid is already in use → "Session ID … is already in use" → exit 1, or
// `claude --resume <uuid>` where the conversation doesn't exist → "No
// conversation found" → exit 1), the pane's remount machinery would otherwise
// spawn AGAIN, exit AGAIN, forever — piling up hundreds of `claude` processes
// (the bug observed: ~334 procs).
//
// This module is the SYSTEMIC DEFENSE: a pure, side-effect-free state machine
// that counts RAPID, REPEATED early exits and decides when to STOP
// auto-respawning and surface a manual-retry (refresh) state instead. A normal
// single exit (user typed `exit`, or a long-lived session that eventually
// ends) does NOT trip the breaker — only a tight loop of early failures does.
//
// Kept pure so the decision is unit-testable without rendering AgentChatPane
// or booting a daemon (see `chat-spawn-breaker.test.ts`).

/** A child exit exits "early" if it dies within this window of being spawned.
