/**
 * LLM CLI "working" detection via viewport text scanning.
 *
 * Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Aider etc. each render a status line near
 * the bottom of their TUI while processing a request. The hint text in
 * that status line ("esc to interrupt", "Waiting for…", "Thinking…") is
 * the most stable signal — much more reliable than title-prefix glyphs,
 * which cycle rapidly and sometimes disappear mid-frame.
 *
 * We scan the last few rows of the rendered grid on each frame. If any
 * known hint appears → the pane is working. A short debounce window
 * handles the gap between frames (the hint isn't always present in every
 * single frame — e.g. during tool-call rendering it can blank out
 * briefly).
 *
 * Substrings are matched case-insensitively. They're chosen to be the
 * stable parts of each tool's status line — hint text rather than the
 * rotating verb/adjective, since verbs change across versions and hints
 * don't.
