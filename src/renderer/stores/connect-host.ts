// connect-host store — the host-aware connection substrate for K2 Connect
// (PRD: .k2so/prds/k2-connect-client-ux.md, build order step #1).
//
// The desktop client can target ANY daemon: the local bundled daemon
// ("This Mac"), a self-hosted box, or a hosted K2 Connect server. This
// store holds WHICH daemon the renderer is currently talking to and the
// address book of saved hosts.
//
// ## What lives here now (step #1/#2)
//   - `activeHost`: 'local' | ConnectHost  (default 'local')
//   - `hosts`: ConnectHost[]               (the saved address book)
//   - selectHost / addHost / removeHost mutators
//   - localStorage persistence of the host list MINUS the token.
//
// ## Persistence (step #3 — landed)
//   - The NON-SECRET host list persists to `~/.k2so/connect-hosts.json`
//     via the `connect_hosts_{read,write}` Tauri commands (localStorage
//     is kept as a synchronous boot cache / non-Tauri fallback).
//   - REMEMBERED tokens persist to the OS keychain via
//     `k2_secret_{set,get,delete}` (service `K2_CONNECT_KEYCHAIN_SERVICE`,
//     account = host.id). Non-remembered tokens stay in memory only.
//   - `hydrateFromDisk()` runs once at boot: loads the file then resolves
//     each remembered host's token from the keychain. Call it from the
//     app shell.
//
// ## What is deliberately deferred
//   - Remote AcceptancePolicy / soft-reconnect / latency readout
//     (steps #4/#5) — partially landed in the ConnectionGate work.
//
// ## Local is byte-identical
// When `activeHost === 'local'`, daemon-ws.ts resolves the exact same
// Tauri `daemon_ws_url` path it always has. This store is purely
// additive — a fresh install with no saved hosts behaves exactly as
// today.
