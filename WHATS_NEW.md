# K2SO — What's New

User-facing highlights of recent updates. See `release-notes-X.Y.Z.md`
files in the repo root for the full developer-facing changelog.

## 0.39.0 — Clean foundation: new CLI, unified sidebar, chat/inbox everywhere

The first public release after a major behind-the-scenes refactor. K2SO
got a lot tidier — same product, cleaner bones. Things you'll notice:

- **Workspaces sidebar simplified.** The "Agents & Pinned" auto-promote
  behavior is gone — agent-mode workspaces no longer get a dedicated
  section forced above your manually pinned workspaces. **A one-time
  migration on first launch pins every workspace that was in agent
  mode** so nothing moves on you visibly: the workspaces that lived in
  the auto-promoted Agents section will still appear at the top of
  your Pinned list. If you don't want them pinned, right-click → Unpin
  any of them — they'll flow into the normal ungrouped / focus-group
  sections. Future workspaces you switch into agent mode won't
  auto-pin; you decide where they go. Same for the Workspaces Settings
  page where you organize what shows up in your nav.

- **Chat + Inbox tabs visible for every workspace** — even ones with
  agent mode set to "off". Every workspace is reachable via cross-
  workspace messaging (`k2so msg <workspace>`), so the inbox surface
  is always available now. Previously these tabs hid when agent mode
  was off, which made the receive side invisible.

- **New CLI** with 24 cleaner verbs across daily / power / internal
  tiers. Old verbs like `k2so delegate`, `k2so work create`, `k2so
  who`, `k2so roster` now print a helpful error pointing at their
  replacement (`k2so inbox compose`, `k2so connections list`, etc.).
  See `release-notes-0.39.0.md` for the full deprecation map.

- **Storage shapes consolidated**: `.k2so/work/` → `.k2so/inbox/` and
  `.k2so/agents/<name>/` → `.k2so/skills/<harness>/`. The daemon
  migrates existing workspaces on first launch; no manual steps
  required. Your inbox items and skills survive — they just live in
  cleaner paths now.

- **Daemon-first foundation.** Most logic moved from the desktop shell
  into the daemon so the same code can power K2 Connect / K2 Companion
  (coming in 0.40.0). Mobile companion's pending-reviews badge, the
  desktop Review Queue UI, the heartbeat triage, and `cli` commands
  all share one source of truth now. **Bug fixes shipping with this**:
  `/cli/agentic` settings no longer 400s, review queue no longer
  silently shows 0, regenerated SKILL.md / CLAUDE.md / AGENT.md use
  the new CLI verbs, chat-history dedup for Pi / Codex / Cursor-IDE
  parsers, trash test infra hardened against macOS Touch ID flakes.

Plus a long list of internal cleanup — see `release-notes-0.39.0.md`
for the developer-facing catalog.

## 0.38.13 — Faster launch + smarter memory threshold

Cleanup pass on 0.38.12's two big additions:

- **Launch speed.** The What's New popup's "is daemon ready?" retry
  loop used to block a Tauri worker thread for up to 5 seconds at
  app startup, contending with all the other launch-time work. Now
  the retry happens renderer-side via plain `setTimeout` (yields
  between attempts) and the popup's first check is deferred until
  2 seconds after the rest of the UI has painted.
- **Smarter memory warning.** The 800 MB threshold was firing
  immediately on app launch because the local LLM loads ~1+ GB of
  weights into the process address space. The watcher now captures
  a settled baseline at the second sample and warns only on
  **growth** above that (+800 MB) or a hard ceiling (3 GB). Either
  signals a real leak; LLM steady-state is silent.

## 0.38.12 — Memory watcher + quieter heartbeat audit log

Two improvements driven by an overnight crash report:

- **Renderer memory watcher.** K2SO now logs its own memory usage
  every 5 minutes (visible in the Web Inspector console as
  `[k2so/memory] rss=...MB`). If the app ever crosses 800 MB you'll
  see a toast suggesting a restart. Gives us telemetry to catch
  Tauri-side memory leaks before macOS reaps the app under pressure.
- **Heartbeats auto-disable when WAKEUP.md is missing.** Before:
  a deleted or unreadable WAKEUP.md caused the heartbeat to retry
  every tick, spamming the audit log with `failed to compose wake
  prompt`. Now: the heartbeat flips to disabled on the first miss,
  records a single `auto_disabled` audit entry, and stays quiet
  until you fix the file and re-enable it from Settings →
  Heartbeats.

## 0.38.11 — Split popup into auto-fire vs button-trigger

Small architecture fix to the "What's new" popup. The popup is now
explicitly two-purpose:

- **Auto popup on the main screen** — fires once on first launch
  after a K2SO update. Same as before.
- **Button popup in Settings** — only opens when you click
  **Read what's new** in Settings → General. Never auto-fires when
  you happen to open Settings between updates.

Same modal UI in both places; just cleaner separation under the hood.

## 0.38.10 — Heartbeats on freshly-flipped agent workspaces

Hotfix: if you flipped a workspace to Custom / Workspace Manager /
K2SO Agent and immediately tried to add a heartbeat, you'd hit
"No scheduleable agent found in this workspace." Cause: the
validation was looking at `.k2so/agent/AGENT.md` on disk to confirm
"this is an agent workspace," but a mode-flip writes the DB
declaration immediately while AGENT.md may not be written yet.

Now: heartbeat add/remove/rename trust `projects.agent_mode` — the
column that's the source of truth for "this workspace is configured
as an agent." If the mode is set, you can schedule heartbeats
without waiting for any specific file to appear on disk.

## 0.38.9 — "Read what's new" works while Settings is open

Tiny hotfix to 0.38.8's new Settings button. Before: clicking
**Read what's new** in Settings → General appeared to do nothing —
the popup only appeared after you closed Settings. Cause: the popup
component wasn't mounted in the Settings-open layout, so the
button's open-popup event had nowhere to land.

Now: the popup opens immediately on top of Settings, no need to
close anything first.

## 0.38.8 — Cmd+T tabs remember their conversations + popup fixes

Two follow-ups to 0.38.5 and 0.38.7:

- **Cmd+T `claude` tabs now resume their conversations** across daemon
  restarts (app updates, kickstart, crash). Before: tabs came back as
  fresh claude sessions. Now: they pick up exactly where you left off,
  same as pinned chat does.
- **"What's new" popup wasn't appearing** for some users after the
  0.38.7 update — the renderer was checking the daemon before
  credentials were written, missing the popup entirely. Fixed with a
  short retry window so it survives launch races.
- **New "Read what's new" button** in Settings → General (under the
  CLI version row) — reopen the popup anytime to re-read what changed
  in the current release.

## 0.38.7 — Update notes when K2SO updates

You're seeing this because K2SO now shows a small "what's new" popup
the first time you open the app after an update. It rolls up everything
you missed if you skipped a version or two — no more wondering what
changed.

- Friendly per-update highlights
- Catches you up across multiple versions if you skipped a few
- `k2so whatsnew` reprints them anytime from the terminal
- `k2so whatsnew --reset` makes the popup show again next launch
  (good for sharing with a teammate)

## 0.38.6 — Inter-agent messages just work

`k2so msg <workspace> "text"` now delivers reliably on the first try.
The "send it twice and pray" workaround that agents were using is no
longer needed.

- One canonical JSON response shape every call — no more guessing
  whether `injected_to_pty: true` actually meant delivered.
- When delivery fails, you get a specific `reason` and an actionable
  `hint` instead of a silent inbox fallback.
- Recipients see `[from <sender>]` prefixed on every message, so they
  always know who's talking.
- `--wake` is no longer needed — `msg` is always live. Use
  `k2so work send` when you actually want to queue something for later.
- `k2so msg --help` finally works.

## 0.38.5 — Cmd+T tabs survive app updates

Your terminal tabs (including pinned chat) keep their `claude` sessions
through app updates and daemon restarts.

Before: a tab opened with `claude` would become a plain shell after the
next K2SO update. Now it comes back as `claude` — same command, same
working directory, same args. Subsequent updates won't reset your tabs
back to a shell.

## 0.38.4 — Heartbeats panel polish

The Heartbeats settings panel now matches the rest of the app's theme.
Heartbeat list is sorted alphabetically (case-insensitive — workspaces
named `alakazam-labs-website` and `BIG-CRM` no longer cluster apart).
Cosmetic only; no behavior change.

## 0.38.3 — System-wide Heartbeats settings page

Added a right-hand panel to the Heartbeats settings showing every
heartbeat across every workspace with toggles for enable/disable,
pinned-chat opt-in, and edit-wakeup. Plus a third column for a running
audit log of every fire system-wide — so you can finally see at a
glance which heartbeats are firing and which are dark.

## 0.38.2 — Heartbeats finally fire reliably

If you had heartbeats configured but they hadn't been firing for a
while (sometimes weeks), 0.38.2 fixes it. We replaced our hand-rolled
scheduler with the well-tested `croner` crate. Heartbeats now recover
cleanly from any pause and fire on schedule.

## 0.38.0 — Daemon-authoritative tabs + multi-window sync

Terminal tabs, including the pinned chat, now persist correctly when
the Tauri app closes and reopens — the daemon owns the sessions, and
the renderer attaches to whatever's already running. Cross-window
state (heartbeats minimized, pinned chat refresh, etc.) syncs
automatically.
